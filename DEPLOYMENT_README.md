# English Text Analyzer - Deployment Guide

## 🚀 GitHub Pages Deployment

This project is configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

### Prerequisites

1. **Repository Setup**: Ensure your repository has the following structure:
   ```
   your-repo/
   ├── docs/                    # GitHub Pages source
   │   ├── index.html          # Main application
   │   ├── static/             # CSS, JS, assets
   │   └── templates/          # Report templates
   ├── .github/workflows/      # GitHub Actions
   │   └── pages.yml          # Deployment workflow
   └── README.md
   ```

2. **GitHub Pages Configuration**:
   - Go to your repository Settings
   - Navigate to "Pages" section
   - Set Source to "GitHub Actions"
   - The workflow will automatically deploy from the `docs/` folder

### Automatic Deployment

The deployment is triggered automatically when:
- You push changes to the `main` branch
- Changes are made to files in the `docs/` directory
- You manually trigger the workflow

### Manual Deployment

To manually trigger deployment:
1. Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository
2. Select "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"

### Deployment Status

Check deployment status:
- **Actions Tab**: View workflow runs and logs
- **Environments**: See deployment history and status
- **Pages Settings**: View the live URL

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

No server-side environment variables needed. The application runs entirely client-side.

### API Keys

Users provide their own Gemini API keys:
- Keys are stored locally in browser storage
- No server-side key management required
- Keys are never transmitted to external servers (except Google's Gemini API)

    branches: [ main ]
    paths: [ 'docs/**' ]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

## 🧪 Testing

### Frontend Tests

Run tests by opening: `docs/tests/frontend-tests.html`

Tests include:
- API key management
- Analysis engine functionality
- UI component behavior
- Export functionality
- Error handling

### Manual Testing Checklist

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Client-Side Security

- **API Keys**: Stored in browser localStorage with basic encoding
- **No Server**: Eliminates server-side security concerns
- **HTTPS**: GitHub Pages provides HTTPS by default
- **Content Security**: No external scripts except from trusted CDNs

### Privacy

- **Data Processing**: Text analysis happens via Google's Gemini API
- **No Tracking**: No analytics or user tracking implemented
- **Local Storage**: Results stored only in user's browser
- **No Persistence**: No server-side data storage

## 📊 Performance Optimization

### Loading Performance

- **Minimal Dependencies**: No heavy frameworks
- **Optimized Assets**: Compressed CSS and JS
- **Lazy Loading**: Analysis modules loaded on demand
- **Caching**: Browser caching for static assets

### Runtime Performance

- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in API rate limiting
- **Caching**: Analysis results cached locally
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JS
- **Responsive**: Optimized for various screen sizes

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Deployment Issues

1. **Workflow Fails**
   - Check file paths in workflow
   - Verify repository permissions
   - Ensure all required files exist

2. **Pages Not Loading**
   - Check GitHub Pages settings
   - Verify index.html exists in docs/
   - Check for JavaScript errors in browser console

3. **Analysis Not Working**
   - Verify API key format and validity
   - Check network connectivity
   - Review browser console for errors

### Debug Steps

1. **Check Workflow Logs**
   - Go to Actions tab
   - Click on failed workflow
   - Review step-by-step logs

2. **Test Locally**
   - Serve docs/ folder with local server
   - Test all functionality before deployment

3. **Browser Developer Tools**
   - Check Console for JavaScript errors
   - Verify Network requests are successful
   - Test with different browsers
